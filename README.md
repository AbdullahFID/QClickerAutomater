EDUCATIONAL SECURITY RESEARCH TOOL - PROOF OF CONCEPT

This extension demonstrates critical security vulnerabilities in attendance-tracking systems, specifically Queen's University's Qlicker platform. Its purpose is to prove the ineffectiveness and unreliability of mandatory attendance software that lacks proper authentication and anti-automation safeguards.

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:
This tool serves as a proof of concept to illustrate how easily automated attendance systems can be circumvented when they rely solely on client-side interactions without server-side validation, rate limiting, or human verification mechanisms. By automating the detection and joining of Qlicker sessions, this extension exposes fundamental design flaws in attendance enforcement technology.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY (For Demonstration Only):
1. Monitors Qlicker dashboard for live sessions
2. Automatically joins detected sessions
3. Submits attendance responses
4. Maintains session state throughout lectures

ETHICAL STATEMENT:
We DO NOT condone cheating, academic dishonesty, plagiarism, or misrepresentation of attendance. This tool is intended solely to:
- Highlight security gaps in educational technology
- Encourage development of more robust attendance verification systems
- Demonstrate the need for multi-factor attendance validation
- Promote discussion about effective vs. performative attendance policies

DISCLAIMERS:
⚠️ This extension has NO AFFILIATION with Queen's University, Qlicker, or any educational institution
⚠️ Use entirely at your own risk and responsibility
⚠️ May violate your institution's academic integrity policies
⚠️ Intended for security research and policy critique only
⚠️ Users assume all legal and academic consequences

The existence of this tool should prompt institutions to implement stronger attendance verification (biometrics, proctoring, randomized timing, etc.) rather than relying on easily automated systems.
